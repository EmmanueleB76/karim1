                        protection
                        from sudden changes in temperature and also protects our vital organs. <br> Fats consists of a
                        wide
                        group of compounds are soluble in organic solvents and insoluble in water. <br> Fats provide 9
                        calories per gram. <br> When dietary fat is digested, fatty acids are produced. <br> It is also
                        important
                        for healthy skin and blood pressure regulation. <br>
                        There are two types of fats Saturated (solid at room temperature) and Unsaturated (liquid at
                        room temperature). <br> To obtain an adequate amount of linoleic acid, one of the few fatty
                        acids
                        the body cannot produce on itself. <br> Any adult needs one tablespoon of unsaturated fat daily.
                        <br>
                        Saturated fats mainly occur in dairy products like butter, cream, cheese and some chocolates.
                        <br>
                        The source of unsaturated fats are soybean, sunflower and corn oils.

                        to make our body function properly. <br> The term vitamin was derived from 'vitamine', a
                        combination word from Vital and Amine. <br> Today a chemical compound is called a vitamin. <br>
                        Our body needs vitamins as substances to grow and develop normally. <br> There are 13 vitamins
                        necessary for our body. <br> Some of them are A, B, C, D, E, K, vitamin B-6 and vitamin B-12.
                        <br> In
                        our daily life we get all most all these vitamins form foods whatever we take. <br> Our body can
                        also produce vitamins D and K. <br>
                        Each vitamin plays specific jobs. <br> Any particular low levels of vitamins cause deficiency
                        disease. <br> For example, if we don't get enough vitamin D it can cause rickets. <br>
                        Deficiency of
                        vitamin 'A' can cause Night Blindness. <br>
                        If we eat a balanced diet we get enough essential vitamin automatically form our daily food
                        or liquid. <br> We don't even need to take any particular vitamin separately. <br> Only in some
                        cases
                        we need to take a daily multivitamin for optimal health.
